# game-project-frogger

My game will be a simplified version of the classic Frogger game

My game will use the usual canvas, css, javascript, and html

###Perceived steps

1. Create the board
2. Separate half the board for the road and the other half for the water
3. Create the frog character's dimensions
4. Create the move function and map to arrow keys
5. Create the moving cars
6. Create the moving logs
7. Create the hit conditions/announce hit/restarts game option button appears
8. Creat the win condition
9. Create win counter/update via win conditions/annouce win
10. Restart from the beginning given win with oncoming obstacles increasing their speed

I would love to have unique random images of cars and different animals upon which to jump along with the logs but I dont want to get too ahead of myself.
